# loadtestingGoEmbeddedDbs
VERY simple Load testing Go embedded databases.  :)

## Results:
**Currently this only tests Sequential writes**, as I was evaluating these dbs for archiving of lots of small events.  I'll add Random writes, Random Read and Sequential Reads tests later.

### My test system:
8 core i7, 16GB memory and SSD.
